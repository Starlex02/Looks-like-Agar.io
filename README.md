<h1 align="center">Node Agar.io</h1>

## Description
This project was implemented from scratch in node.js and websocket. It is a game similar to agar.io, created by Mateus Valadares. I was inspired by this project and tried to implement something similar on my own. From the original game, I implemented player movement, eating other players, increasing the player's size, and connecting several players to one session.

## How to play
1. Press the arrows on the keyboard to move
2. Eat the cells on the map to grow in size
3. Eat other players when you are bigger than them in size

## Project setup
```
npm install
npm start
```
